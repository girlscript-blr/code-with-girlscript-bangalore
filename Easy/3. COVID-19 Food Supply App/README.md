> Date : 1st September 2020

## Prerequisites

- Basic input output of strings and numbers.
- One of `Class`/`Object`/`Dictionary`/`Map` to store survey details. (Depends on the language you are using)
- Creating and displaying arrays.
- Basic calculation.

## Problem Statement

Mr. Banku Yadav has just started with his NGO. During this Covid-19 pandemic, he decided to do a fundraiser to help the people in need. He found a slum nearby named Nayandahalli where he saw people who were in need of food and ration kits.

Before starting with the fundraiser he thought of exploring the slum and thereby conducted a survey. When Banku Yadav reached Nayandahalli he found out that there were a lot of people and collecting each and everyoneâ€™s record manually would become a tedious process. So he thought of creating an app that will make his task easier in conducting the survey. Banku Yadav is not a tech-savvy person to build a survey app.

It is your time to rise and shine as you have a golden opportunity to help Banku Yadav create an app for conducting his survey. Refer the sample input and output examples given below to create your app.
