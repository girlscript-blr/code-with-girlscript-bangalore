## About the program

Welcome to GirlScript Bangalore's brand new initiative! If you are a techie 👨‍💻👩‍💻, if you want to get started with open source contribution 💻, if you are looking to improve your programming skills 📈, you have landed in just the right place! ⬇

The aim of this program is to help the participants explore the Open Source world and take their first step towards programming and contributing.

If you are starting your journey in Free and Open Source Software Development, then this is the right place. 😄 This program is also ideal to coding enthusiasts who would like to challenge their problem solving skills.

We have a range of problem statements for beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels for you to solve 📝. The problem statements are independent of any technology stacks, so you can focus on the underlying concepts.

> Participants are free to use any programming language of their choice. The solution would earn contributors their badge as **THE NEOPHYTE** 🥉 on completing beginner level problem. We also have the **THE EXPLORER** 🥈 and **THE AFICIONADO** 🥇 badges on completion of the intermediate and advanced levels respectively. If your pull requests in all levels get merged, at least a week before the deadline, you can earn your exclusive **GEEK OF THE GEEKS** 🏆 special recognition badge every month!🎉🎉

> 🎁🏅 These E-badges will be rewarded on completion of each level. You will also get rewarded with a bonus badge on early completion of each level! We will be using the Badgr platform for distributing Open Badges. Grab your badges by making your contribution.😃

Follow the steps/guidelines mentioned in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file, and "Optimize and Elevate".

## Problem Statements

- [Beginner Level Problems](Easy/README.md)
- [Intermediate Level Problems](Medium/README.md)
- [Advanced Level Problems](Hard/README.md)

## General Guidelines

- In the monthly challenges, each level may have a separate deadline that will be mentioned along with each problem statement. Eligibility of rewards is subject to strict adherence to the mentioned deadlines.
- You are free to attempt any question beyond the deadline as well. However, the submission will not be eligible for rewards post the submission date.
- Raise a pull request only when you are satisfied with the solution.
- For each problem statement, a detailed form of the question has been provided in the readme files of the corresponding levels.
- A screenshot showing the results must also be pushed along with the final submission. A brief description(not more than 4-5 lines/100 words) should be included containing the approach used for solving the problem. - Make this submission in a document format, containing both description and simulation/output screenshot(s).
- Contributors who are able to complete all levels of a problem statement will have a chance to join the team of Reviewers.
- The problems have been segregated in a way that you can choose the level of complexity you would like to begin with. You can directly solve the Advanced level of a problem statement, or progress towards it by attempting Beginner or Intermediate levels.
- It goes without saying that plagiarism is strictly discouraged. Kindly refrain from the urge to do it.
