The solution is framed in Python.It uses basic data structures like dictionary,lists and sets. For input user is requested to enter the total number of people voluteering for the survey after then they have to enter details/information according to the statements being displayed in output(although this was not asked in original problem but I included that for better understanding and this can be easily removed/updated).At the end two tables will be dispalyed according to problem statement showing various inforamtion about the data collected.Do let me know if something is wrong or needs to be updated
