## Problem Statement

Mr. Banku Yadav has just started with his NGO. During this Covid-19 pandemic, he decided to do a fundraiser to help the people in need. He found a slum nearby named Nayandahalli where he saw people who were in need of food and ration kits.

Before starting with the fundraiser he thought of exploring the slum and thereby conducted a survey. When Banku Yadav reached Nayandahalli he found out that there were a lot of people and collecting each and everyoneâ€™s record manually would become a tedious process. So he thought of creating an app that will make his task easier in conducting the survey. Banku Yadav is not a tech-savvy person to build a survey app.

It is your time to rise and shine as you have a golden opportunity to help Banku Yadav create an app for conducting his survey. Your task is to help Banku Yadav in estimating the quantity of each food item along with its price and the total amount required to be funded based on the total number of people. Refer the sample input and output examples given below to create your app.

#### Total Amount Required = Sum of Prices

### Note

> - **Person Info Table** should display the number of people as per their age category.
> - In the **Food Info Table**, the **Required Quantity** is the sum of number of food items(in kg or number of units) selected by each individual on taking the Survey.
>   - Calculate the following by referring to the **Monthly Food Stock Table**(as above)
>     - **Quantity** = Required Quantity as per Survey X No. of Packets per Food Item
>     - **Price** = Required Quantity X Monthly Quantity X Price from Monthly Food Stock
> - Total Amount can be calculated based on the Sum of Prices in the Food Info Table.

#### Food Info:

| Food Item                   | Required Quantity                  | Monthly Quantity | `Price(Rs.) = RequiredQuamtity * Monthly Quantity * Price per unit` |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rice in Kg per day          | `750+500+600 = 1850grams = 1.85kg` | 30               | `1.85*30*40 = 2220`                                                 |
| Dal in Kg per day           | `400+200+250 = 850grams = 0.85Kg`  | 30               | `0.85*30*65 = 1657.5`                                               |

| Tiger/Parle G Biscuits      | 1                                  | 30               | `1*30*3 = 90`                                                       |
| Nandini Milk TetraPacks 1lt | 2                                  | 8                | `2*8*45 = 720`                                                      |
| Bread                       | 1                                  | 4                | `1*4*25 = 100`                                                      |
| Calcium Sandoz Tablets      | 1                                  | 1                | `1*1*500 = 500`                                                     |

#### Total Amount Required = Sum of Prices = 2220+1657.5+400+90+720+100+500 = Rs. 5687.5
