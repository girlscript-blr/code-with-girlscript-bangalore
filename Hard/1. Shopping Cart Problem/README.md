# Shopping Cart Problem - Hard

> Date : 1st July 2020

## Prerequisites
- Basic input output of strings and numbers.
- Nested conditional statements.
- One of `Class`/`Object`/`Dictionary`/`Map` to store shopping items. (Depends on the language you are using)
- Creating, displaying & manipulating arrays.
- Array sorting & filtering.
- Basic calculation.
- Getting the current date & time and displaying it in human readable form.
- Reading and writing data to permanent storage. (files, database, etc) Refer [this](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/files/) for using files in C++.
- Complex user interface for implementing different modes and features.

## Problem Statement

In this section, `GadgetifyWithGSBlr` features two exclusive modes:

1. ‘Vendor mode’ which allows the admin to perform various tasks like adding shopping items, viewing and filtering customer’s orders and changing the status of the orders.

2. ‘Customer mode’ is for the user to create new orders taking into account additional parameters like distance and Order ID(for the customers to track the status of their orders). The functionality for checking the status of previous orders should be added.The customer should be able to retrieve data after restarting the app.

The app has to generate a bill accordingly containing all the details provided by the user and the total amount. The appropriate status of the orders has to be included.

### Vendor mode

- Vendor can do the following tasks:
  - Add shopping category
  - Add shopping item
  - View all customer orders and filter & sort them based on status (status can be ‘in progress’, ‘completed’, ‘canceled’), billing date, total amount, delivery option.
  - View all shopping categories and filter & sort them with name.
  - View all shopping items and filter & sort them with name, category, original price, discount price.
  - Change order status.
- All the shopping items, categories and orders should have unique IDs.
- Shopping items must include
  - Name
  - Original price
  - Discount price
  - Weight in grams
- All the data should be stored in such a way that it is retrieved even after the app restarts. (It can be achieved by using file storage, database storage, etc).

### Customer mode

- Customer can perform the following tasks
  - Create a new order
  - Check the status of a previous order

#### Creating an order

- When the application runs, the user must be asked the following.
  - Name
  - Phone no
  - Payment method `(cash/card/online)`
  - Select multiple shopping items and it’s quantity.
    `For Example, the user can select 3 basshead earphones & 2 bluetooth computer mouse`
  - Takeaway / Home delivery
  - Distance from shop to the delivery address in KM. (if Home delivery is selected)
  - Shipping Address (if Home delivery is selected)
- The shopping items should be displayed category wise as stored by the verdor.
- While listing the shopping items, the application should display the original price, discounted price, and the amount saved by the user if he/she buys that product.
- The shop doesn’t provide home delivery to addresses more than 50KM away. If the user selects a distance more than 50KM, an appropriate message should be displayed.
- The app should generate a bill for the selected item(s), including a 6% tax on the total amount.
- The total amount should include a shipping charge if Home delivery is selected. The shipping charge is to be calculated as:
  | Distance | Price |
  |----------|-------------|
  | <= 5 KM | Free |
  | <= 20 KM | Rs. 30 |
  | <= 50 KM | Rs. 60 |
  | > 50 KM | No delivery |
- The bill should show the total amount saved by the user if he/she bought any discount products.
- The bill should contain all the details provided by the user.
- The bill should contain the shop details as well as the billing date and time.
- Each order should have a unique ‘Order ID’ such that the user can use to check the status. This Order ID should be automatically generated by the application when an order is created.
- The default status of the order should be ‘in progress’ on order creation.
- All the data should be stored in such a way that it is retrieved even after the app restarts. (It can be achieved by using file storage, database storage, etc).

#### Checking order status

- The customer should enter the order ID and the app should return the bill (as in ‘create order’) along with the current order status.
