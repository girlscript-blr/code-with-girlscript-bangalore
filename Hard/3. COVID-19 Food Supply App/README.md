# COVID-19 Food Supply App - Hard

> Date : 1st September 2020

## Prerequisites

- Basic input output of strings and numbers.
- One of `Class`/`Object`/`Dictionary`/`Map` to store survey details. (Depends on the language you are using)
- Creating and displaying arrays.
- Basic calculation.
- Array filtering.
- Basic calculation.
- Reading and writing data to permanent storage. (files, database, etc) Refer [this](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/files/) for using files in C++.
- Complex user interface for implementing different modes and features.

## Problem Statement

Mr. Banku Yadav has just started with his NGO. During this Covid-19 pandemic, he decided to do a fundraiser to help the people in need. He found a slum nearby named Nayandahalli where he saw people who were in need of food and ration kits.

Before starting with the fundraiser he thought of exploring the slum and thereby conducted a survey. When Banku Yadav reached Nayandahalli he found out that there were a lot of people and collecting each and everyone’s record manually would become a tedious process. So he thought of creating an app that will make his task easier in conducting the survey. Banku Yadav is not a tech-savvy person to build a survey app.

It is your time to rise and shine as you have a golden opportunity to help Banku Yadav create an app for conducting his survey. Banku Yadav’s app proved to be successful in estimating the quantity of each food item along with its price and the total amount required to be funded based on the total number of people.

The state government noticed Banku Yadav’s efforts and got impressed with his idea. The government wants him to do the same for other slums as well. So Banku Yadav approaches you for updating the app. Now you should automate the Survey App so that records of more slums and a variety of food items can be maintained. While collecting survey records of each individual you should also collect their slum’s name. The app should store details in the form of a database or files.

Your task is to create an App that should support the following functionalities:

**Two types of Users:**

1. **Admin**

   - **Add/Update Slum Records**

     - App should ask the user to fill the **Slum Name** & **Description**(general slum locality address) and details should be stored in a table/file.
     - The Table/file named **Slum Details** should maintain fields/columns like **Id, Slum Name, Description**.
     - App should check if **Name** already exists in the table/file or not. If Slum name already exists, it should just update the record in place of creating a new one to avoid redundancy of records.

   - **Update Food Products with Prices per quantity**

     - App should allow the user to fill **Monthly Food Stock** details like **Product Name, Price & Monthly Quantity**.
       > Here **Monthly Quantity** is the total number of Food item packets to be distributed to an individual for a Month/30 days.
     - The Table/file named **Monthly Food Stock** should maintain fields like **Id, Product Name & Monthly Quantity**.

   - **Estimate Total Quantity of food products & Total Amount Required**

     - **Fetch Food Info By Area Name**: User should just enter the Slum Name and the App should return the following as Output:

     #### Total Amount Required = Sum of Prices

     ### Note

     > - **Person Info Table** should display the number of people as per their age category.
     > - In the **Food Info Table**, the **Required Quantity** is the sum of number of food items(in kg or number of units) selected by all individual on taking the Survey.
     >   - Calculate the following by referring to the **Monthly Food Stock Table**(as created from above **Update Food Products with Prices per quantity** functionality)
     >     - **Quantity** = Required Quantity as per Survey X No. of Packets per Food Item
     >     - **Price** = Required Quantity X Monthly Quantity X Price from Monthly Food Stock Table
     > - **Total Amount** can be calculated based on the Sum of Prices in the Food Info Table.

     ### Example for Calculating Food Info Table & Total Amount Required

     After taking survey of 3 Individuals we got to know

     - Person A enters or selects
       - 750grams of Rice per day

     #### Food Info:

     | Food Item                   | Required Quantity                  | Monthly Quantity | `Price(Rs.) = RequiredQuamtity * Monthly Quantity * Price per unit` |
     | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
     | Rice in Kg per day          | `750+500+600 = 1850grams = 1.85kg` | 30               | `1.85*30*40 = 2220`                                                 |
     | Dal in Kg per day           | `400+200+250 = 850grams = 0.85Kg`  | 30               | `0.85*30*65 = 1657. 5`                                              |
     | Canned Fruits               | 1                                  | 4                | `1*4*100 = 400`                                                     |

     | Nandini Milk TetraPacks 1lt | 2                                  | 8                | `2*8*45 = 720`                                                      |
     | Bread                       | 1                                  | 4                | `1*4*25 = 100`                                                      |
     | Calcium Sandoz Tablets      | 1                                  | 1                | `1*1*500 = 500`                                                     |

     #### Total Amount Required = Sum of Prices = 2220+1657.5+400+90+720+100+500 = Rs. 5687.5
